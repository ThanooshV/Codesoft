# Rule-Based Chatbot

## Project Description
This project implements a simple rule-based chatbot using Python.
The chatbot responds to user inputs based on predefined rules using
conditional statements.

## Objective
To understand basic Natural Language Processing concepts and
conversation flow using rule-based logic.

## Technologies Used
- Python

## How It Works
1. The chatbot accepts user input from the terminal.
2. The input is converted to lowercase.
3. Predefined rules are checked using if-else conditions.
4. A suitable response is displayed.
5. The program continues until the user types "bye".

## How to Run the Project
1. Install Python.
2. Save the program as chatbot.py.
3. Open terminal in the project folder.
4. Run the command: python chatbot.py

## Features
- Greeting responses
- Basic keyword matching
- Exit functionality

## Learning Outcome
This project helped in understanding rule-based chatbots,
conditional logic, and basic NLP concepts.
